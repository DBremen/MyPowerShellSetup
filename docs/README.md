# My PowerShell Setup

> This is the documentation of my PowerShell setup mainly focused on productivity on the PowerShell command-prompt and easy maintenance of installed packages. It is not meant to be another [awesome list](https://github.com/janikvonrotz/awesome-powershell), but merely my own tools/customizations that I find useful and help me to re-produce the environment on a new machine.
